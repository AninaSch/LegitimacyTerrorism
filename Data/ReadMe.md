# Read Me: data

Original -- raw -- datasets are downloaded from various sources and saved in "Original Data".

The datasets from "Original Data" are loaded with the scripts in "Scripts/Data Processing", processed (i.e. selection of variable of interest, renaming variables, filtering by year, tidied, ...) and saved in "Processed Data".

The tidy datasets in "Processed Data" are then loaded by the script "tbd" and merged together and saved in "Data for Modelling". This or these datasets will then be used for the statistical modelling.
